meho anime/game completion list:
(categorized by year; contains title(Japanese), short review, progress.

My Favorite: 
⭐ひぐらしのなく頃に:
Very suspenseful plot. A classic to watch during the summer.
I watched higurashi when I was like a 6th-grader. It scared the 💩 out of me, but in the end I really loved it. 
Reincarnation and infinite loops as an anime theme was relatively new at that time and I, just like many other people, found this device very interesting.
I remember Furude Rika being the king of Moe back then. She ends up being one of my favorite anime charaters.

⭐Clannad:
Clannad introduced me to Key, the games of which I played extensively later in my life.
I was learning Japanese in Shanghai when I watched Clannad with old mp4 video player (it's probly not longer a thing now).
I was moved by the relationship between Nagisa and Tomoya, which started from their adolescence and transitioned into adulthood in the second season.
Clannad is life. I concur. It's one of the few anime that depicts the afterstory of romantic relationship.  



2021:
1. 回復術士のやり直し
Review: Literally hentai. Some people call it revenge porn, to which I somewhat agree. 
If you watch it without out your brain on or torturing yourself with the logic, the anime turns out therapeutic when you feel stressed out. 
Let's just forget about humanity, equal rights or whatever mundanity. It's just a fiction.
In fact, I watched it during the dead week and it greatly alleviated my anxiety. I had some good laughs out of it.
Basically なろう系 after the "redo" of ケヤルガ.

The famous lines incude (something like)):
-- which rod do you want? This rod or my rod?  (because of which, the anime is commonly referred to as 棍勇 in the Chinese community)
-- Setsuna seized the future (刹那は未来をつかむ！）. (Setsuna grabbing the rod; the scene was quite hilarious)
Recommend: ♥♥♥♥ 
completion: completed

2.俺だけ入れる隠しダンジョン
Review: Not among the worst Isekai anime, but also not the best. Some parts are pretty funny. The protagonist is a shota.
The way that the protagonist gains "skill point" is quite cliched tho.
The famous line is: 俺だけ入れる隠しダンジョン。こっそり鍛えて世界最強！
Recommend: ♥♥
completion: completed 

3.約束のネバーランド S1-S2
Review: The first season is ok, but the second season is hot garbage. 
It was very sad to see the anime making suboptimal changes to original manga along the way and eventually turning itself into total nonsense.
The horrible adaption urged me to read manga, an activity I hadn't been practicing for years (not a huge fan of manga).
Now you know how bad the anime adaption is. Runnnnnnn and read manga instead!
The depiction of the trio (Norman, Emma, Ray) is very well developed in Manga. The ending is also more natural.
Recommend:💔
completion: completed S1, gave up mid-S2


4.呪術廻戦
Review: Good one but not as good as I expected. I say this because I don't really remember much after watching it, but I can surely see its
potential as an adaption from Jump manga.
Recommend: ♥♥♥♥ 
completion: completed

5.ダーウィンズゲーム
Review: On the more interesting side of this genre. Better than something like 王様ゲーム imo.
Recommend: ♥♥♥
completion: completed
