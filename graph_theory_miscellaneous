1. k-regular graph
a regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors.
from the handshaking lemma, a regular graph contains an even number of vertices with odd degree.
k-regular graph has nk/2 edges.

2. handshaking lemma
in every finite graph, there must be an even number of vertices for which {\displaystyle \deg(v)}\deg(v) is an odd number.
