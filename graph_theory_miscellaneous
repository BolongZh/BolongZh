1. k-regular graph
a regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors.
from the handshaking lemma, a regular graph contains an even number of vertices with odd degree.
k-regular graph has nk/2 edges.

2. handshaking lemma
in every finite graph, there must be an even number of vertices for which deg(v) is an odd number.

3. complete graph
a complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.

4. simple graph
A simple graph, also called a strict graph (Tutte 1998, p. 2), is an unweighted, undirected graph containing no graph loops or multiple edges 

5. bipartite graph

6. Hamilton path/cycle
a Hamiltonian path (or traceable path) is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits 
each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian path that is a cycle.

7. matching
a matching or independent edge set in an undirected graph is a set of edges without common vertices. 

8. maximal vs maximum matching
maximum matching: the independent edge set has maximum cardinality of all possible matchings
maximal matchingï¼› no other edges can be introduced into the current matching

9. perfect (or complete) matching
perfect matching: a perfect matching in a graph is a matching that covers every vertex of the graph. 
More formally, given a graph G = (V, E), a perfect matching in G is a subset M of E, such that every vertex in V is adjacent to exactly one edge in M.
Bijection between two disjoint edge sets; thus, a perfect matching implies even number of vertices.
